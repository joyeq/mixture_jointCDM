# Joint Cognitive Diagnostic Modeling for Different Item Response and Item Omission Mechanisms
This repository contains R scripts for simulating data based on the JCDM-RT-NA model and estimating the model using the fully Bayesian approach.

## Files Overview

1. **`simulation.R`**:  
   This script contains the functions to simulate data based on the JCDM-RT-NA model.
   
2. **`estimation.R`**:  
   This script contains the R codes to estimate the JCDM-RT-NA model and its competing models using the R2jags package.

3. **`empirical.R`**:  
   This script contains the R codes to estimate empirical data based on the JCDM-RT-NA model.

4. **`empiricalData.RData`**:  
   This file contains the empirical dataset.

5. **`JCDMRTNA.txt`**:  
   This file contains the Jags code for the JCDM-RT-NA model.
   
7. **`JRTRG.txt`**:
